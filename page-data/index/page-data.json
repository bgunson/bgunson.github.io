Unluckily, that semester covid came to town and all in-person teaching was suspended. The Pi since sat in my drawer with not much use other than collecting dust. Most recently I have been involved in developing web applications for data acquisition and visualization at an internship with SVSControls, a small industrial automation company specializing in PLC programming and industrial computer networks. Toward the end of my placement I thought I should use my Raspberry Pi for a small-scale data server for my vehicle. My passion and interest in web-based systems drove me to start OnBoardPi, a Raspberry Pi based OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) web server. This project began with testing many OBD libraries and tackling the challenge of actually installing the Pi in a vehicle.","title":"Raspberry Pi Graceful Shutdown
