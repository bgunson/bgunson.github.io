Unluckily, that semester covid came to town and all in-person teaching was suspended. The Pi since sat in my drawer with not much use other than collecting dust. Most recently I have been involved in developing web applications for data acquisition and visualization at an internship with SVSControls, a small industrial automation company specializing in PLC programming and industrial computer networks. Toward the end of my placement I thought I should use my Raspberry Pi for a small-scale data server for my vehicle. My passion and interest in web-based systems drove me to start OnBoardPi, a Raspberry Pi based OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) web server. This project began with testing many OBD libraries and tackling the challenge of actually installing the Pi in a vehicle.","title":"Raspberry Pi Graceful Shutdown Circuits","link":"https://bengunson.me/blog/software/hardware/2022/01/13/shutdown-circuits.html","pubDate":"January 13, 2022"}]},"github":{"user":{"repositories":{"nodes":[{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDU=","name":"Python","color":"#3572A5"},"size":7350}]},"id":"R_kgDOGd8Pxg","name":"obd-socketio","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/obd-socketio","description":"Expose the python-OBD Async API on a Socketio Server"},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UyODc=","name":"TypeScript","color":"#3178c6"},"size":105515},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U0MTc=","name":"HTML","color":"#e34c26"},"size":41522},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDU=","name":"Python","color":"#3572A5"},"size":36735},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDA=","name":"JavaScript","color":"#f1e05a"},"size":12926},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U2MDU=","name":"SCSS","color":"#c6538c"},"size":8180},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U1MzU=","name":"Dockerfile","color":"#384d54"},"size":557}]},"id":"R_kgDOGoXmiQ","name":"onboardpi","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/onboardpi","description":"OBD web server for vehicles"},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDA=","name":"JavaScript","color":"#f1e05a"},"size":8931},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U0MTc=","name":"HTML","color":"#e34c26"},"size":6482},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UzMDE=","name":"Processing","color":"#0096D8"},"size":2455}]},"id":"R_kgDOIiITqg","name":"311project","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/311project","description":null},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDA=","name":"JavaScript","color":"#f1e05a"},"size":86061},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U0MTc=","name":"HTML","color":"#e34c26"},"size":4806},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UzMDg=","name":"CSS","color":"#563d7c"},"size":4795}]},"id":"R_kgDOHKvuzA","name":"learnlylog","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/learnlylog","description":"A simple learning management system that allows users to track their progress"},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDA=","name":"JavaScript","color":"#f1e05a"},"size":20340},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UzMDg=","name":"CSS","color":"#563d7c"},"size":4555}]},"id":"R_kgDOGqm3gg","name":"bgunson.github.io","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/bgunson.github.io","description":"My Root Website"},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDU=","name":"Python","color":"#3572A5"},"size":49526}]},"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4ODcwOTA=","name":"TaffyTangle","url":"https://github.com/bgunson/TaffyTangle","description":"A match three game made in Python for first year assignment"},{"languages":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UxNDA=","name":"JavaScript","color":"#f1e05a"},"size":86061},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2U0MTc=","name":"HTML","color":"#e34c26"},"size":4806},{"node":{"id":"MDg6TGFuZ3VhZ2UzMDg=","name":"CSS","color":"#563d7c"},"size":4795}]},"id":"R_kgDOHA5FxA","name":"learnlylog","url":"https://github.com/richardnorman/learnlylog","description":"A simple learning management system that allows users to track their progress and share their learning progress with their friends. Also contains extra features like a live chat, badges after completing each course and progress bars for the current completion percentage of each course. Courses can teach the user about a variety of topics, like cooking, electronics, and like we learned in this class, programming languages. Courses will consist of modules, users can either view modules or complete modules to actually earn the course badge by taking a formulation of some skill/learning assessment at the end of each module. These skill/learning assessments will consist of either a multiple choice, true or false, or written/short answer questions that they would need to get right before stamping them as completing the module of the course. In the nav bar of the page there will be a learning log icon, when clicked on, the user can view their progress on all modules and courses in different time intervals, such as their progress in one month, one week and one day. They can share this information and the badges they earn through a link they send to their friends. The idea is a social learning
